<p>Do you find yourself in need of some companionship in your life from a fury friend but not sure if your current lifestyle is cut out for it?
Well, this is the best quiz to allow you to figure these questions out.</p>

shelters experienced an influx of dogs for instance. People did not properly assess whether their lifestyle outside of the pandemic would be able 
to handle a fury companion. In order to assess this for yourself moving forward, this quiz will take you through a couple of statements in which 
the user will answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide details as to whether they require more of a low or high maintentance pet.</p>
